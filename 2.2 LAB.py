# 1.1
# Example 1
# The len() function used for strings returns a number of characters contained by the arguments. hn 

word = 'by'
print(len(word))
>> 2

# Example 2
# Any string can be empty. Its length is 0.

empty = ''
print(len(empty))
>> 0

# Example 3
# a backslash (\) used as an escape character is not included in the string's total length. 

i_am = 'I\'m'
print(len(i_am))
>> 3

# 1.2
# Multiline strings
multiline = '''Line #1
Line #2'''

print(len(multiline))
>> 15
# Line #1 contains seven characters. Two such lines comprise 14 characters. 
# The missing character is simply invisible - it's a whitespace. It's located between the two text lines.
# It's denoted as: \n.
# The multiline strings can be delimited by triple quotes, too.

# 1.3
# Operations on strings
# In general, strings can be:

# concatenated (joined)
# replicated
# The ability to use the same operator against completely different kinds of data (like numbers vs. strings) is called overloading (as such an operator is overloaded with different duties).
# The + operator used against two or more strings produces a new string containing all the characters from its arguments (note: the order matters - this overloaded +, in contrast to its numerical version, is not commutative).
str1 = 'a'
str2 = 'b'

print(str1 + str2)
>> ab
print(str2 + str1)
>> ba
print(5 * 'a')
>> aaaaa
print('b' * 4)
>> bbbb

# 1.4
# Operations on strings: ord()
# To know a specific character's ASCII/UNICODE code point value, you can use a function named ord() (as in ordinal).
# The function needs a one-character string as its argument - breaching this requirement causes a TypeError exception, and returns a number representing the argument's code point.
# Demonstrating the ord() function.

char_1 = 'a'
char_2 = ' '  # space

print(ord(char_1))
>> 97
print(ord(char_2))
>> 32

# 1.5
# Operations on strings: chr()
# The function takes a code point and returns its character.
# Invoking it with an invalid argument (e.g., a negative or invalid code point) causes ValueError or TypeError exceptions.
# Demonstrating the chr() function.

print(chr(97))
>> a
print(chr(945))
>> Î±

# 1.6
# Strings as sequences: indexing
# Indexing strings.

the_string = 'silly walks'

for ix in range(len(the_string)):
    print(the_string[ix], end=' ')

print()
>> s i l l y   w a l k s 

# Strings as sequences: iterating
# Iterating through a string.

the_string = 'silly walks'

for character in the_string:
    print(character, end=' ')

print()
>> s i l l y   w a l k s 

# 1.7
# Slices
alpha = "abdefg"

print(alpha[1:3])
>> bd
print(alpha[3:])
>> efg
print(alpha[:3])
>> abd
print(alpha[3:-2])
>> e
print(alpha[-3:4])
>> e
print(alpha[::2])
>> adf
print(alpha[1::2])
>> beg

# 1.8
# The in and not in operators
# The in operator
# The in operator shouldn't surprise you when applied to strings - it simply checks if its left argument (a string) can be found anywhere within the right argument (another string).
# The result of the check is simply True or False.
alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

print("f" in alphabet)
>> True
print("F" in alphabet)
>> False
print("1" in alphabet)
>> False
print("ghi" in alphabet)
>> True
print("Xyz" in alphabet)
>> False

# The not in operator

print("f" not in alphabet)
>> False
print("F" not in alphabet)
>> True
print("1" not in alphabet)
>> True
print("ghi" not in alphabet)
>> False
print("Xyz" not in alphabet)
>> True

# 1.9
# Python strings are immutable
#doesn't allow you to use the del instruction to remove anything from a string.

# Write test code here.
del alphabet[0]
>> TypeError: 'str' object doesn't support item deletion
