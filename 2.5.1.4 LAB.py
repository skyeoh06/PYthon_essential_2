# The IBAN Validator
# The standard says that validation requires the following steps (according to Wikipedia):

# (step 1) Check that the total IBAN length is correct as per the country (this program won't do that, but you can modify the code to meet this requirement if you wish; note: you have to teach the code all the lengths used in Europe)
# (step 2) Move the four initial characters to the end of the string (i.e., the country code and the check digits)
# (step 3) Replace each letter in the string with two digits, thereby expanding the string, where A = 10, B = 11 ... Z = 35;
# (step 4) Interpret the string as a decimal integer and compute the remainder of that number by modulo-dividing it by 97; If the remainder is 1, the check digit test is passed and the IBAN might be valid.

# start the actual processing

    # move the four initial characters to the number's end, and convert all letters to upper case
